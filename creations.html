                            This project is a simple Alarm Clock that displays the current time and allows 
                            the user to input as many alarms as they'd like. The app also sorts and displays 
                            the list of alarms in order of arriving first. After an alarm sounds, it will 
                            move to the bottom of the list. This program was written in Python and uses the modules
                            datetime, time, custom Tkinter, and winsound.

                        <p>As a final project of my sophomore year me and my partners created a program to compare types of 
                          sorting algorithms with different types of lists. The user is able to choose the
                          type of array they want to use. Array types are sorted, partially sorted, reversed, and random. The
                          user will be able to input the length of the array and the type of sorting algorithm they want to
                          test. The output will provide the user the sorted array and the time it took the algorithm to sort it.
