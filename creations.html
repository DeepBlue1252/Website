                        <p>
                            This project is a simple Alarm Clock that displays the current time and allows 
                            the user to input as many alarms as they'd like. The app also sorts and displays 
                            the list of alarms in order of arriving first. After an alarm sounds, it will 
                            move to the bottom of the list. This program was written in Python and uses the modules
                            datetime, time, custom Tkinter, and winsound.

                        <p>As a final project of my sophomore year me and my partners created a program to compare types of 
                          sorting algorithms with different types of lists. The user is able to choose the
                          type of array they want to use. Array types are sorted, partially sorted, reversed, and random. The
                          user will be able to input the length of the array and the type of sorting algorithm they want to
                          test. The output will provide the user the sorted array and the time it took the algorithm to sort it.

                        <p>My project is my first attempt at a micro Saas project, and it's currently in progress. The program 
                          I'm developing is capable of taking in a txt file and identifying entities such as speakers and important 
                          locations/scenes. Once identified, the program creates a class with the entities as keys and their 
                          descriptive attributes as values. To achieve these tasks, I'm leveraging the OpenAI API.

                        <p>I've used data analysis and captivating visualizations to explore the connection between anime 
                          series duration and viewer ratings, as well as the historical trends in anime's popularity. </p>

                      <p>This indie RPG project represents a pivotal point in my software development journey. Transitioning 
                        from coding everything manually to employing the versatile asset "GameCreator 2" allowed me to 
                        visually script complex game mechanics with ease. Through this experience, I've honed my skills in 
                        game design, UI implementation, and music integration. Crafting a captivating narrative and developing 
                        diverse character classes challenged me to think creatively and strategically. This project underscores 
                        my commitment to creating immersive gaming experiences and showcases my adaptability and growth as a 
                        developer. It's not just a game; it's a testament to my evolving proficiency and passion in the world 
                        of software development.</p>
