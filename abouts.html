                        <p>
                                My Computer Science journey started with coding games in highschool. This is when 
                            I realized coding was something I wanted to do as a career. After taking some of 
                            my first classes in college, I started to find coding fun. The problem solving aspect
                            of coding was really addicting to me. Small errors that would annoy most felt like a game 
                            to me. Where finding and solving them granted me so much satisfaction. Coding is now a 
                            hobby and activity I pursue in my free time. Learning new skills, structures, 
                            and algorithms feel like gaining levels in a videogame and I want to reach even farther.
